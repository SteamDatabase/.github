## Contributing

### I want to report a bug

- Look at the open and closed issues to see if this was not already discussed before.
  If you can't see any, feel free to open a new issue.
- If you think you discovered a security vulnerability, **do not open a public
  issue on GitHub.** Refer to our [security guidelines](/SECURITY.md) instead.

### I want to contribute to the code

- Make sure to discuss your ideas with the community.
- Take a look at the open issues labeled as `help wanted`
  if you want to help without having a specific idea in mind.
- Make sure that your PRs do not contain unnecessary commits or merge commits.
  [Squash commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)
  whenever possible.
- [Rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) (instead of
  merge) outdated PRs on the default branch.
